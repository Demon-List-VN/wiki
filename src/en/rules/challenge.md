# Challenge List Rules

## Level

- The level must be completable and verifiably valid.
- The level must not contain secret paths or fatal bugs.
- If a fatal bug is discovered, the level must be updated within one week.
- Any level with unacceptable gameplay (e.g., wave spam, flying straight for 10 km, ...) will not be approved. The final decision lies with the staff.
- The level must be longer than 5 seconds.
- The level should have a difficulty of "Insane" or higher (not required to be marked in-game).
- If an accepted level is removed from the GD server, it will be removed from the list.
- If the video of an accepted level is deleted, it will be replaced by a player's recording; if no replacement exists, the level will be removed.

## Submissions

- Use of tools, hacks, fatal bugs, and secret paths is prohibited.
