# Platformer List Rules

- When submitting a time, ensure the time is formatted correctly (0:00:00.000).
- A full record (raw footage) is ideal, but an edited video must include at least 5 minutes of footage per checkpoint (or capture all attempts starting from each checkpoint).
- Click sounds and raw footage are required for extreme demons.
- Two-player levels must be completed solo. For two-player extreme demons, recordings of hand movements are required (except for 'the guards mission' and 'Ice Climbers').
- Click Between Frames (CBF) and Platformer Saves are not allowed. However, Platformer Saves may be accepted if:
  - the level is completed with checkpoints located in the same place, or
  - the level has no checkpoints (e.g., We Forgot Everything, Aerios, etc.).

**Note:** If you play a level that has only one checkpoint (for example, Crerro Kaizo II with a countdown intro) but still use Platformer Saves, you should not take the checkpoint.

- Completing a level by skipping long sections or using secret shortcuts may cause your record to be rejected (short skips are allowed).
- We recommend checking Pemonlist for the list of allowed hacks/mods/programs.
