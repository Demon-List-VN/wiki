# Classic + Featured List Rules

- Records missing an FPS counter, click sounds, or raw footage will be rejected immediately (for extreme demons).
- A record must reach the level's minimum required progress to be accepted.
- Records that use unauthorized hacks, secret shortcuts (skipping the hardest parts of a level), or that are stolen from others will not be accepted. We recommend checking Pointercrate's list of allowed hacks.
- For Featured List creators, the level must be a rated demon and created and uploaded by Vietnamese authors (or have at least 50% contribution from Vietnamese creators).
